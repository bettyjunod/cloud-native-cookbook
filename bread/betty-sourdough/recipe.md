# Sourdough

It's 2020 and 6 months into varous shelter in place / quarantine timelines it seems like everyone is making bread, specifically sourdough. A friend gave us some sourdough starter in June 2019 and after 6 months of stone breads, breads that stuck to the pot, ok breads, and pancake breads -- I've finally figured out a good method that turns out a good bread for us in our climate (SF).

## Mule Dough

No sourdough is complete without a name or knowing its origin story. Ours came from a starter that was named "Mule Dough." The story goes... Our friend had a visitor (friend of their sibling) stay over on their way from Oregon to Southern CA. During their one night stay, the visitor randomly asked for flour and then explained that they had to feed their starter. They got their starter from their grandmother along with the story that it originated from a starter 100+ years old having come across on a mule train headed west. During the journey, the mule train fell down a cliff or ravine and the father hiked down to gather up as much of their belongings as they could...and the starter was one of those them. Hence the name Mule Dough.

## Bubbles is their name!

The children named our starter Bubbles and insisted that Bubbles is gender neutral and I am here for it. Bubbles has a steady diet of Central Milling bread flour and sometimes a bit of wheat or tye flour.

## My sourdough

Over the last year I've tried a number of different sourdough recipes from [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/extra-tangy-sourdough-bread-recipe), [The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/beginners-sourdough-bread/), and [Tartine Bakery](https://youtu.be/U4dyWZZVeWI). They are all generally the same recipe with slight variations. My recipe is a bit of a mix of all these together...

WARNING: I am not a diligent with my measuring (if I measure at all) so your mileage may vary. Also I don't use a scale, I loosely use measuring cups.

Ingredients -- this will make 2 loaves
 * 3 cups bread flour
 * 2 cups all purpose flour
 * 1 cup fed starter
 * 1 cup warm water
 * 2 Tablespoons of salt
 
_What does ["fed starter"](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/feeding-and-maintaining-your-sourdough-starter-recipe) mean?_ As a rule of thumb, I either feed Bubbles just before I go to sleep and then start my dough after I wake up OR I feed Bubbles first thing in the morning and then start the bread dough in the late afternoon.

Warm up the water and pour into a big bowl. Add the starter and then mix around. 
Add both flours and then mix until the dough looks pulled together and then kind of knead/punch until it's a little smoother.
Then there's this step called autolyse where you're supposed to let it sit for 20 minutes before adding salt. Sometimes I wait, sometimes I don't and I haven't noticed a difference in the bread.
Every 20-30 minutes or so, stretch and fold the dough to get all the lovely gluten to start working. (side note: I have forgotten to do this for hours at a time bc of meetings, and it's fine). After a few hours of this, you can shape and put into the fridge for the overnight rise.

Shaping -- check out the Tartine video for instruction.

Do you need a banneton? 
Nope. I just dust the dough in flour and put into a ramen or cereal bowl. I'm just too lazy to buy more tools on this front. 

Put the dough (in it's basket/bowl) into a plastic bag (with clip) or a big mixing bowl with lid into the fridge.
