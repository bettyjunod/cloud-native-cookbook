# Virtual Dinner Party 

I've been taking pictures of things I've cooked or baked since forever and in recent years have been sharing them on Twitter. The best parts of the internet and social media are when random topics can bring people together. From liking another's bread pic, to asking for help on a recipe, getting recommendations, to just sharing something good and happy. 

So at the suggestion of a [friend](https://twitter.com/BettyJunod/status/1315002282941980672?s=20), here's the start of a repo to share pics and recipes. It's ok if you didn't create the recipe, just share links to the original recipe and add your notes and tips that made the recipe yours. 

2020 has been especially tough and as social creatures, the acute pain of 2020 is that we cannot physically console and comfort each other. Nothing can ever replace sitting at a table with new and old friends, sharing a meal and stories of our lives -- to cry and laugh together. One day we'll get to hang out in person again and even share a meal... but until then, let's have a virtual dinner party!

## Everyone is Welcome 

Please feel free to organize, make suggestions, anything! I am not a well-versed GitHub user so I'm going to need some help from the engineers out there :)
